# interview-bit-solutions
This is a codebase of all my interviewbit solutions. 
I am on a journey to hone my data structure and algorithms skills with a target of coding every day. The motive for the same is striving to be an effective computer enginner which will lead to a job oppurtunity in campus placements in my coming academic year.
